**Pele (Edson Arantes do Nascimento)**
--------------------------------------
**Desclaimer**
If you jumped to this page first, Fùtbol is what most of the world calls the sport, we Americans call Soccer. 


	  	Pele is considered by many, especally his peers in the professional Fùtbol world to be the best player of the century. Reason for this, he was voted by a commitee of peers as the best player of the century by an imense margin 63% ( `Wikipedia Player of the Century <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ FIFA_Player_of_the_Century>`_ ). He is a Brazilian Soccer Legend, who is known to those, who really know nothing about the sport he played. He has a record 3 world cup wins to his name, he has a couple world records `FIFA Pele World Cup Stats <http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=63869>`_ `Pele 10 Compiled Statistics  <http://www.pele-10.com/pele-statistics.html>`_ `Guinness World Record Stats <http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-career-goals-(football)>`_. My personal opinion he is the best to ever play, but I know i am no alone in thing this, just by the sheer margin of victory when voted best player of the century by his peers.That gives hime the real credit to being a contender for greatest soccer player ever, as  do his stats below,they truely back him up with a lot of legitmacy for the claim of greatest player. This man is why i wanted to be a pro Soccer player a a little kid. Pele is great just look at the sheer number of goals he has to his name. He left a mark on the world of soccer that can't be understated. He played the game professionally for 21 years `Pele 10 Compiled Statistics  <http://www.pele-10.com/pele-statistics.html>`_ . When taking a look at the numbers it hard to deny the sheer incredible skill this man has, and what an insperation he has been to 2 generations of brazilian kids and kids around the world.
