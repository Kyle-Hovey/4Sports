The History of Basketball


The Inventor of Basketball was Dr. James Naismith, what became the sport we know as basketball started as a child's game that Dr. Naismith used to play as a kid in Ramsay Township, Ontario, Canada. Kids tried to knock a “duck” off of a large rock with a smaller rock. He attended McGill University. In 1891 he ended up in Springfield, Massachusetts at a YMCA. He tried to create a sport that could be played indoors during the winters and used skill instead of just strength. It started with a soccer ball as the playing ball and two peach baskets.
